<h1>Cruise Ships GUI</h1>

Cruise Ships GUI is a JavaScript project that simulates the movement of a cruise ship as it travels between different ports. It is built upon the Cruise Ships project, and it provides users with an interactive user interface to add ports to a ship's itinerary and set sail.

    <li>Domain Modelling</li>
    <li>Object-oriented Programming</li>
    <li>Single Responsibility Principle</li>

<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Allows users to add new ports to the itinerary.</li>
  <li>Displays the current and next port in the "heads-up" display.</li>
  <li>Animates the ship moving between ports.</li>
  <li>Changes the background image of the viewport to simulate the appearance of the sea.</li>
  <li>Displays a message when the ship departs or arrives at a port.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<p>Clone the repository:</p>
<pre><code>git clone https://github.com/your-username/cruise-ships-gui.git</code></pre>
<p>Install the dependencies:</p>
<pre><code>npm install</code></pre>

Next, simply open the index.html file in your web browser to load the simulation interface.

To start your journey, you'll need to plan your itinerary by adding at least two ports using the form. Enter the name of each port in the input field and click "Add". If the name is valid and not already in the itinerary, the new port will be added.

When you're ready to hit the high seas, just click "Set Sail!" and watch as the ship gradually moves towards the next port. The headsUp element will keep you informed about your current location and upcoming destinations.

And don't worry about getting lost at sea â€“ if you reach the end of your itinerary, a message will be displayed on the simulation viewport to let you know your virtual voyage is complete.
